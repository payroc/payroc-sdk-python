        Use this method to return a list of owners of a funding recipient.

        **Note:** If you want to view the details of a specific owner and you have their ownerId, use our [Retrieve Owner](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/owners/retrieve) method.

        To list the owners of a funding recipient, you need its recipientId. Our gateway returned the recipientId in the response of the [Create Funding Recipient](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/funding/funding-recipients/create) method. If you don't have the recipientId, use our [List Funding Recipients](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/funding/funding-recipients/list) method to search for the funding recipient.

        Our gateway returns the following information about each owner in the list:
        -    Name, date of birth, and address.
        -    Contact details, including their email address.
        -    Relationship to the funding recipient.

        Our gateway also returns the ownerId, which you can use to perform follow-on actions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        recipient_id : int
            Unique identifier that we assigned to the funding recipient.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]
            Request-specific configuration.

        Returns
        -------
        typing.List[Owner]
            Successful request. Returns a list of all owners associated with the funding recipient.

        Use this method to add an additional owner to a funding recipient.
