        Use this method to cancel or to partially cancel a payment in an open batch. This is also known as voiding a payment.

        To cancel a payment, you need its paymentId. Our gateway returned the paymentId in the response of the [Create Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/payments/create) method.

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentId, use our [List Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/payments/list) method to search for the payment.

        If your request is successful, our gateway removes the payment from the merchant's open batch and no funds are taken from the cardholder's account.

        Parameters
        ----------
        payment_id : str
            Unique identifier of the payment that the merchant wants to retrieve.

        idempotency_key : str
            Unique identifier that you generate for each request. You must use the [UUID v4 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) for the identifier. For more information about the idempotency key, go to [Idempotency](https://docs.payroc.com/api/idempotency).

        operator : typing.Optional[str]
            Operator who reversed the payment.

        amount : typing.Optional[int]
            Amount of the payment that the merchant wants to reverse. The value is in the currency’s lowest denomination, for example, cents.
            **Note:** If the merchant doesn’t send an amount, we reverse the total amount of the transaction.

        request_options : typing.Optional[RequestOptions]

        Use this method to refund a payment that is in a closed batch.

        To refund a payment, you need its paymentId. Our gateway returned the paymentId in the response of the [Create Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/payments/create) method.

        **Note:** If you don't have the paymentId, use our [List Payments](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/payments/list) method to search for the payment.

        If your refund is successful, our gateway returns the payment amount to the cardholder's account.

        **Things to consider**

        - If the merchant refunds a payment that is in an open batch, our gateway reverses the payment.
        - Some merchants can run unreferenced refunds, which means that they don't need a paymentId to return an amount to a customer. For more information about how to run an unreferenced refund, go to [Create Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/create-unreferenced-refund).

        Use this method to adjust a refund in an open batch.

        To adjust a refund, you need its refundId. Our gateway returned the refundId in the response of the [Refund Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/create-referenced-refund) method or the [Create Refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/create-unreferenced-refund) method.

        **Note:** If you don’t have the refundId, use our [List Refunds](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/list) method to search for the refund.

        You can adjust the following details of the refund:
        - Customer details, including shipping address and contact information.
        - Status of the refund.

        Our gateway returns information about the adjusted refund, including:
        - Order details, including the refund amount and when we processed the refund.
        - Payment card details, including the masked card number, expiry date, and payment method.
        - Cardholder details, including their contact information and shipping address.

        If the refund is a referenced refund, our gateway also returns details about the payment that the refund is linked to.

        Parameters
        ----------
        refund_id : str
            Unique identifier that our gateway assigned to the refund.

        idempotency_key : str
            Unique identifier that you generate for each request. You must use the [UUID v4 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) for the identifier. For more information about the idempotency key, go to [Idempotency](https://docs.payroc.com/api/idempotency).

        adjustments : typing.Sequence[RefundAdjustmentAdjustmentsItem]
            Array of polymorphic objects that contain information about adjustments to the refund.

            The value of the type parameter determines which variant you should use:
            -    `status` - Status of the transaction.
            -    `customer` - Customer's contact information and shipping address.

        operator : typing.Optional[str]
            Operator who requested the adjustment to the refund.

        Use this method to refund a payment that is in a closed batch.

        To refund a payment, you need its paymentId. Our gateway returned the paymentId in the response of the [Create Payment](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/payments/create) method.

        **Things to consider**

        - If the merchant refunds a payment that is in an open batch, our gateway reverses the payment.
        - Some merchants can run unreferenced refunds, which means that they don't need a paymentId to return an amount to a customer.

If you use our Refund Payment method, our gateway sends the refund amount to the customer's original payment method and links the refund to the payment.

        In the request, you must provide the customer's payment details and the refund amount.

        In the response, our gateway returns information about the refund and a refundId, which you need for the following methods:

        - [Retrieve refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/retrieve) - View the details of the refund.
        - [Adjust refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/adjust) - Update the details of the refund.
        - [Reverse refund](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/card-payments/refunds/reverse-refund) - Cancel the refund if it's in an open batch.

        Parameters
        ----------
        idempotency_key : str
            Unique identifier that you generate for each request. You must use the [UUID v4 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) for the identifier. For more information about the idempotency key, go to [Idempotency](https://docs.payroc.com/api/idempotency).
