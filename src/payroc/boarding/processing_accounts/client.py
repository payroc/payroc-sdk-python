        Use this method to prompt a merchant to sign their pricing agreement.

        You can create a reminder only if you requested the merchant’s signature by email when you created the processing account for the merchant.

        To create a reminder, you need the processingAccountId. Our gateway returned the processingAccountId in the response of the [Create Merchant Platform](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create) method or [Create Processing Account](https://docs.payroc.com/api/schema/boarding/merchant-platforms/create-processing-account) method.

        When you send a successful request, we send an email to the merchant that prompts them to sign their pricing agreement.

        Parameters
        ----------
        processing_account_id : str
            Unique identifier that we assigned to the processing account.

        idempotency_key : str
            Unique identifier that you generate for each request. You must use the [UUID v4 format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4122) for the identifier. For more information about the idempotency key, go to [Idempotency](https://docs.payroc.com/api/idempotency).
